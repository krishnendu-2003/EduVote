# Decentralized Voting System

A modern, blockchain-based voting system that ensures secure, transparent, and efficient voting processes. Integrated with MetaMask, this system allows users to cast and verify votes directly from their wallets.

## Features

- **Secure Voting**: Votes are recorded on a tamper-proof blockchain.
- **Transparent Records**: All votes are publicly verifiable on the blockchain.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple integration with MetaMask for easy voting.
- **Efficient**: Streamlined voting process that reduces time and costs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) browser extension
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) for deploying smart contracts

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krishnendu-2003/EduVote
   cd EduVote
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your MetaMask private key:

   ```env
   ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY='your-private-key'
   ```

4. **Compile Smart Contracts**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

5. **Deploy Smart Contracts**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network opencampus
   ```

### Usage

1. **Start the Frontend**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Access the Application**

   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`. Connect your MetaMask wallet to interact with the voting system.

## Smart Contract ABI

Ensure that the ABI is correctly configured in your frontend application. Example ABI is available in `src/abi/VotingContract.json`.
